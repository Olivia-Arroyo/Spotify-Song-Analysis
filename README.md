# Spotify-Song-Analysis
An analysis project exploring the most streamed Spotify songs of 2023 using the Kaggle datatset.

Streaming services have revolutionized the music industry. Spotify was a pioneer in this music revolution; shifting the focus from album sales to immediate, unlimited access to music. 

For this project I investigated the opportune time of year for releasing songs and identified key attributes influencing a songâ€™s popularity, providing valuable insights for record labels to guide artists and producers in creating and releasing music with a higher potential for recognition.
