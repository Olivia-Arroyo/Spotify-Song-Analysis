# Spotify-Song-Analysis
<h2>An exploratory analysis using R to analyze the Kaggle Dataset The Most Streamed Spotify Songs of 2023.</h2>

For this project I investigated the opportune time of year for releasing songs and identified key attributes influencing a song’s popularity, providing valuable insights for record labels to guide artists and producers in creating and releasing music with a higher potential for recognition.
